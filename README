This parser has been included into phobos 2.058 (still yet to be released) as std.csv. There are breaking changes, but should not be severe.

This project is built from branches. In stead of having every library I create reside in the same branch I am placing them in their own branch.

I don't know if this is the best idea, but I can always merge my branches if I decide to.
