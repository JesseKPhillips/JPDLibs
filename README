This project is built from branches. In stead of having every library I create reside in the same branch I am placing them in their own branch.

I don't know if this is the best idea, but I can always merge my branches if I decide to.

Current projects are:

cmdln.interact -- Provides a nicer interface to commandline interaction with the user.
spelling.suggest -- Suggest a word from a misspelled word. Requires training.
